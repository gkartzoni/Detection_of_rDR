Greek hyphenation patterns for use with xetex.
----------------------------------------------

The files included in the archive are:
 - xgrmhyph.tex (for modern polutonic and monotonic Greek),
 - xgrahyph.tex (for ancient Greek),
 - xgrcodes.tex (category, upper/locwecase codes for all Greek letters).

The hyphenation patterns are just the standard hyphenation patterns
by D. Philippou adapted for use with xetex (only the catcodes, etc.,
files are my completely original contribution).
